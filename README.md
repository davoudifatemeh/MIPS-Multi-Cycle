# MIPS Processor (Multi-Cycle)
The MIPS processor is designed as multi-cycle and supports the following commands:

‫‪Arithmetic/Logical‬‬ ‫‪Instructions:‬‬ ‫‪```add,‬‬ ‫‪sub,‬‬ ‫‪and,‬‬ ‫‪or,‬‬ ‫‪slt,‬‬ ‫‪addi,‬‬ ‫‪andi```

‬‬‫‪Memory‬‬ ‫‪Reference‬‬ ‫‪Instruction:‬‬ ```‫‪lw,‬‬ ‫‪sw```

‫‪Control‬‬ ‫‪Flow‬‬ ‫‪Instructions:‬‬ ```‫‪j,‬‬ ‫‪jal,‬‬ ‫‪jr,‬‬ ‫‪beq,‬‬ ‫‪bne‬‬```‬

You can see instruction set architecture (ISA) [here](https://github.com/davoudifatemeh/Multi-Cycle-MIPS-Processor/blob/main/Isa03.png).

## Test 1
Adds the elements of a ten-element array (with the starting address of 1000) together and writes the result to memory address 2000.

## Test 2
Finds the largest element of an array of 20 elements (with the starting address of 1000) and writes the value of the largest element and its index to memory addresses 2000 and 2004, respectively.
